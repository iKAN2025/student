## Start shared Frontend Repo using GitHub Pages
I made a team repository from the flask portfolio  We got rid of Time Box or Blog page for customization. We started to try and recreate our  User Interface (UI) according to Frontend Design. Frontend developers will design frontend and screen transitions before data is available, this meet requirements of this step in process.

## Student Repo
We made  Backend Repo using Flask/Flask. We made a team repository from flask portfolio and review flask anatomy and start to customize for your needs, such as app roots.   According to UML design, I thought about defining APIs with static data to support development. Early testing is done with a tool called Postman, this would meet requirements of this step in process.

## Flask Repo
Deploy on AWS

To deploy you need minimal backend software. In fact, you should be able to start deployment process once you start your flask portfolio project. Follow deployment guide. You will need to pick a subdomain using AWS Route 53.
