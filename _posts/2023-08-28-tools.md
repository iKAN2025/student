## Why I Love My Tools


I like using VS Code because it allows me to create a variety of programs-from a simple python program (print("Hello World)) to a website such as this one. I am still learning how to use and navigate VS Code. I also like how you can have interaction between VS Code and Github and how you can push commits to Github as well.

I also like using Slack. The different channels make it easier to organize different conversations, and it also support collaboration.
