## Night At The Mesum 
My group and I were able to present our project to multiple individuals around the room. Some of these included students, parents, younger kids, Mr. Mortensen, and Mr. Yeung. It was really interesting to see how different people responded to our project and how we were able to teach and inform parents about the topic. Many parents were very impressed. My friends gave me ideas to try sorting the table by date of birth, or maybe add a login screen, 

-APCSA and APCSP

After we presented our project I went around the APCSA and APCSP room to see the other projects that were being shown. One project that caught my eye was one of the APCSA projects called “Snapshot”

This project was interesting because it had a successful login page that allowed for each individual to have their own database. It was also really cool how they catered this specific website to those who are in photography classes. In this project they are able to upload images into a image gallery and keep track of all of the photos that they took.
